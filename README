# MadLibMaker
MadLibMaker lets you take text files and load them into mad libs. You can create such files by writing your mad lib, and put anything you want to replace in brackets with the word type.

Example: ```I went to the store and bought some <Noun>.```

Once you've done that, save your file as a .madlib file and run the program. In the program, you can select the file you want to run and enter in your substitutions.
